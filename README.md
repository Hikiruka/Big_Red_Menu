Big Red Menu is the first CIA manager (installer/uninstaller) for 3DS completely legal and opensource.<br><br>
It's wrote in both C++ and LUA (Heavy edited LPP edition) and <b>ACTUALLY works only AS CIA</b>.<br>
So to install Big Red Menu, you'll require BigBlueMenu or devMenu but, after its installation, you can delete these Nintendo copyrighted tools and starts to use Big Red Menu.<br>
<br>Credits:<br>Smealum for libctru<br>Aurelio for helping during the writing of the lua_uninstallCIA code.<br><br>
<b>Note: Big Red Menu lists only SDMC CIAs to prevent users to brick their 3DS with some NAND CIAs importing.<br>
Instead adding NAND and GAMECARD support is very easy.</b>
