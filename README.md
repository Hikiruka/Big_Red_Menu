Big Red Menu is the first CIA manager (installer/uninstaller) for 3DS completely legal and opensource.<br><br>
It's wrote in both C++ and LUA (Heavy edited LPP edition).<br>
<br>Credits:<br>Smealum for libctru<br>Aurelio for helping during the writing of the lua_uninstallCIA code.<br><br>
<b>Note: Big Red Menu doesn't obscure any System CIA (devMenu for example hides DS_INTERNET and a lot of other NAND CIAs) so PAY ATTENTION when you uninstall NAND contents cause you can also corrupt 3DS NAND -> Brick.</b>
